## Ecommerce-Shop

I used MERN(Mongodb, ExpressJs, ReactJs, NodeJs) stack to make this project.

For running this application in local, follow these steps:

Run "npm install" command to install all the dependencies
For backend run "nodemon index.js" command in corresponding backend folder.
For frontend run "npm start" command in corresponding frontend folder.
Project will run in http://localhost:3000/
